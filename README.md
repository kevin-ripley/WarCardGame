# WarCardGame

This code is to show how a programmer can use OOP to create a card game. This card game will be the card game "War" for two players, the player and the computer. If you don't know how to play "War" here are the basic rules:

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.

## The Play:

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player places three cards face down and then one card face up. The player with the higher card takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns the next card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.
